    <p>Composed at my internship at KRUST, Summer of 2021, with the help of Krust's Music AI</p>
    <p>Medium: digital music production (FL Studio)</p>
    <p>genre: pop/acoustic beat</p>
    <p>At my internship at a AI startup called KRUST, aside from learning about the basics of AI
    and machine learning, I also had the chance to play around with the product their were developing.
    The musical AI was trained on a list of successful music in Korea. It could generate a basic melody
    and some chords, which I could import into my DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to compose and mix it
    to my liking.</p>
    <p>The chords that I chose were brilliant: a mix of happiness, melancholy, and relaxation. The melody,
    however, was not as catchy and iconic as I wanted it to be. I mixed up some of the notes, added some
    syncopation and out came a relaxed, summer day beat. To honor my digital collaborative partner, I named
    the piece "return (Summer);" to symbolize the lines of code that helped me with the inspiration for the piece.</p>
