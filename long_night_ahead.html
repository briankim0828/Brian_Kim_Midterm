    <p>Composed at my home in Seoul, Summer of 2021</p>
    <p>Medium: digital music production (FL Studio)</p>
    <p>genre: ambient, atmospheric music</p>
    <p>After my composing "Holden's Theme," I never really had the chance to
    compose another finished piece. I was always on the piano, coming up with
    interesting musical ideas, but I never had the outlet to create a cohesive track
    with my ideas. Then, after I began to learn digital music production, I found
    a tool to combine all of my ideas and give them character through sound design
    and mixing with the audio itself. I became fascinated, and began to work on my second composition.</p>
    <p>After watching "The Social Network," I was mezmerized by Trent Reznor's distorted, electronic
    soundtrack. In order to replicate such a sound with my personal flair, I added a simple piano line
    to tie the piece back to my musical roots. I then combined it with some base guitar lines, drums, and
    synthesizers to create the feeling you get when you're pulling an all-nighter, working on
    homework or a project, hence: Long Night Ahead.</p>
