    <p>Composed at St. Paul's School, Spring of 2018</p>
    <p>Medium: piano</p>
    <p>genre: film music</p>
    <p>After practicing for weeks on classical pieces that I enjoyed,
    I wondered if I could create my own melodies and harmonies, so that
    I could express my emotions and perspective with the language of music.
    Then, as I read The Catcher in the Rye as the last assignment of my Humanities
    class, I felt a profound emotion I have never felt before in my life. It felt like
    Holden was able to verbalize what I couldn't put into words myself: this feeling
    of frustration, anger, confusion, and guilt that came with growth, as I attended
    school an ocean away from the place I call home. After reading the last chapter, I knew
    I needed to do my best to capture this moment with music.</p>
    <p>For me, Holden's journey is one of pure emotional complexity, the beginning of
    adulthood where nothing falls into place as neatly as it seemed when we were children.
    Anger and happiness could coexist, and that's what I felt in the last scene of the book when
    Holden would cry tears of joy in the rain as he looks at his sister going around the
    carousel. The main melody is three notes: a movement from major to minor. When the rain falls,
    the lower registry of the piano creates a grand, poignant sound. I hope you enjoy.</p>
